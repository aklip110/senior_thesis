- this folder is updated as of 4/22

-Goal: convert the "on", "off", and "deltaB" scripts to callable functions
	-then call them and be able to easily plot new datasets and overlay multiple plots
FILES:
	1. get_data.py: general functions to get either the on or off data--is called in the deltaB_general.py file

-To Do (4/20):
	-convert "on" and "off" to callable functions
		-all they do is grab and save the desired data given a few inputs
	-convert "deltaB" to a callable function that first calls the "on" and "off"
	-save the final arrays generated by "deltaB" to a running, mutable csv file in this directory
	-one input i need to add is a destination directory

-Newest functionality (4/22):
	-plotting.py works great--one function to plot x, y, and z plots
	-sends plots to the designated directory
	-cannot overlay multiple days
	-does not make misalignment corrections

-4/29 updates: most updated code: plotting.py and deltaB_general.py
	-currently trying to find reason for discrepancy between my data and brad's
