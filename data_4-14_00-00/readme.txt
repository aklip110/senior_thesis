4/16: The most updated series of analysis code is in the data_4-14 directory under "error_prop".
You first run the off_ep.py and on_ep.py to grab and transform the on and off data separately. The on and off scripts transform the vertical sweep and the xy data separately and save them separately.  It gets saved in that same folder in two separate files. Note that the transformation in naive and does not include any misalignment corrections yet. The run the deltaB_ep.py file. This will take the two on and off files as input. It averges Bx, By, and Bz and computes their errors and makes error bar plots.  It also computes |B|, its errors, and makes error bar plots. Note that it uses both the xy sweep data and the vertical z sweep data. This code will have to be adapted for volume sweeps, but should work identically for all axis sweeps.
